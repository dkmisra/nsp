## Neural Semantic Parsing with Policy Shaping and Generalized Update Equations

Contains Code for the following paper: 

_Policy Shaping and Generalized Update Equations for Semantic Parsing from Denotations_, 
Dipendra Misra, Ming-Wei Chang, Xiaodong He, Wen-tau Yih in **EMNLP 2018**

Code Coming Soon. For details please contact dkm@cs.cornell.edu

# Docker Images

Docker images for the main experiment are provided here: 

https://hub.docker.com/r/dipendramisra/nsp/tags 

The builds are created to run with the MAVER algorithm with policy shaping. This should match the result reported in the paper. You can download these docker images and modify them to run different algorithms. If you haven't used docker before then please see: https://docs.docker.com/
